# Open questions:

1. I have a `Tabs` React component and I would like to create a variant of it with additional functionality.
this requires about extra ~40 lines of code.

Which of the below strategies would be best and why?

1. Add a new dedicated prop when true the component will use that extra code, which might add complexity to the original Tabs component
2. Use HOC wrapper to enhance the current component
3. Create a variant (new component) which already wraps the original component and adds everything out-of-the-box ready to be used
